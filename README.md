#Viviota HttpClient .NET Library

This library is a light wrapper on the .NET HttpClient class and it's associated classes.  

This has only been tested on Windows systems.  While .NET can be called through Linux, this tool has not been tested there.

This is currently written in LabVIEW 2018 for convenience, however it should be backwards compatible, and has been tested with both 32/64 bit versions of LabVIEW.

The "REST Client_NET.lvlib" library contained in this class is designed to be a subclass for the JKI REST Client Library. Without that dependency, that particular library will be broken.

Additional documentation to follow.
